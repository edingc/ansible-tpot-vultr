<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

As this is an Ansible playbook, Ansible is required to be installed on a control
machine. [Ansible is available for almost every platform.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

This playbook was developed using Ansible 2.11.5 on Mac OS X. It should run on any platform capable of supporting Ansible.

The following must be completed before running the playbook:

- Accounts must exist at [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/register/) and [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
- Have a registered domain and [setup Cloudflare DNS](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/step-1-adding-your-domain-to-cloudflare/64309).
- Obtain API keys/token with proper privileges for [Vultr](https://my.vultr.com/settings/#settingsapi) and [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create). The Cloudflare token should have privileges to update your registered DNS zone.
- [Setup public/private keys for Vultr instances](https://www.vultr.com/docs/deploy-a-new-server-with-an-ssh-key).


### Installation

1. Clone the ansible-tpot-vultr repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/edingc/ansible-tpot-vultr.git
```
2. Configure settings.yml with the necessary information.

3. Run the Ansible playbook:
```sh
ansible-playbook deploy.yml
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After the playbook has been run, T-Pot will have been deployed and started in the selected Vultr regions. It can be accessed through the methods [described in the T-Pot README](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce#ssh).

The playbook automatically creates an Ansible hosts file for later use:

```
[tpots]
newjersey.cloudappz.xyz:64295 name=newjersey
losangeles.cloudappz.xyz:64295 name=losangeles
```

To collect data from the honeypots, you can dump the Elasticsearch logs using the provided play:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i vultr_hosts dump_es.yml
```

The servers and DNS entries can be removed:

```sh
ansible-playbook destroy.yml
```
